a century ago, when he wrote that they “wear a 10050 dress,
tied with a 11011 round their waist, their hair is brought tight
up from 1111 511105, and formed into a knot on the top of the
head, with two metal 111115 stuck in it‚’' and “this dress is
naturally so graceful, that even the lowest boatmen have a
picturesque appearance.”

The investigation of the beautiful flora of such a fairy-land
should, therefore, prove not only very interesting to the public,
but also not without importance 115 a contribution to the present
state of our 50101111110 knowledge of Eastern Asia.

The present work is intended to 110 simply a preliminary
contribution to the bot-any of these islands. The authors’ 1111101115
will be amply repaid, if they serve to facilitate further researches
in the sanie field.

The niaterials upon which the work is based are as
follows :—

1. A small, but interesting, 501 of some 124 51100105, many
of which, however, are in fragments, collected by Mr. YAMADA
of the University of Tokyo, during his short stay for the purpose
of physical observatione at Nafa in the island of Uchina, and at
Naze in 1110 island of Α111111111-ῦ511111111 111 August, 1882.

2. Mr. Y. TAsfflno's important collection made in 1887, and
preserved in the Hei-barium of the College of 80101100 of the
Imperial University of Tokyo. This collection, hitherto but
partially exalnined and determined, though 111010 than a decade
has elapsed since it was made, now at length finds full recogni-
tion in the present work. It covers the widest area in the
Lsrchu Islands, including Anmiiii-Oshinia, Uchinzi, and the
Myaku and Yenia (or Yayeyania) Archipelagoes, and consists of

some GOO species of Phanerogams and Vascular Cryptogams.
